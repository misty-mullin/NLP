Conversly, `b` and `e` are totally different in angle, but in distance they are as close as `b` is to `a`. What this highlights is that it is important what difference metric you use. Partially this knowledge comes with experience of what works, and also what was used to train the model. For instance, you will need to read this up before employing a method for your search algorthim, and do some experimentation."

Surgery   The Nurses desk in the preoperative area was found to have broken Formica on the desk and pulling apart from the frame leaving exposed particle board. This would result in the inability to clean properly and harbor infection. The handle was broken on one of the drawers.  The rolling vital sign machines (used to take the patients vital signs) was found to be soiled with dust and hair.  The pre-operative area had no patients and was considered clean and ready for new patients. Three biohazard trash cans were found to have trash in them.  One of the three post-operative bays was found to be used as a storage area. The bed had soiled shipping boxes on them and was not a clean area. There was only a curtain around the bed and was not sealed off from the other patient beds.  Observation of the six beds used in the pre/post-operative areas were found to be soiled with dust, hair, and rust. Staff # 11 confirmed the same soiled stretchers was taken from pre/op, to surgery, and back out to post op. The dirty beds were taken into the surgery suite exposing the patient to potential hazardous infections.  13 Blue top blood vials were found in the pre-op/post- op area expired. The tubes were ready for patient use and had expired in May of 2018.  27 Tiger top blood vials were found in the pre-op/post- op area expired. The tubes were ready for patient use and had expired in June of 2018.  Room \"C\" in the pre-op/post-op area had clean surgical uniforms hanging on a rack. The uniforms were used for staff to put on for surgery. The uniforms were not covered. The uniforms were in a room with soiled equipment. The floor of the room was soiled with dust and hair. The bed in the room had a soiled mattress and dirty blanket wadded up on the mattress. Three wheel chairs were found in the room uncovered and soiled with dust and hair.  In the medication room, medical supplies and office supplies were co-mingled. Paper forms were stacked in a particle board divider next to patient supplies. The particle board divider was dusty and soiled. The cabinet space used to count and prepare medications was soiled.  In the medication room, a metal sink was found to be heavily soiled and rusted. A black plastic box was found sitting next to the sink. The box was heavily soiled with dust and a white residue. The top of the box said \"bait box\".  In the medication room a sharps container (holds dirty used needles) was found to be hanging on the wall. The top of the box was covered with white residue.   2.) Patient Isolation Room 175  The room was used for patients that require isolation from other patients, to prevent the spread of contagious disease, or to protect the patient from an infectious disease. The room was considered clean and waiting to be used by a new patient. The door was found propped open with a piece of cardboard from a box.  A wooden chair was found in the room with multiple scratch marks exposing the porous wood underneath. This could be a source of possible infection.  The bed linen was found to have holes.  The bedside table had nicks in the table exposing particle board. The bedside table was rusted on the legs and soiled with dust and hair.  The patient monitor was dusty and the time on the monitor was not correct. The monitor was 13 minutes fast. There was no up to date preventative (PM) sicker on the monitor. The time was 2:59PM and the monitor said 15:12 (3:12PM).  Behind the head of the bed, the floor was found to be soiled with dust and trash.  The wall behind the bed was found to be missing paint and sheetrock was exposed.  The IV pole was found to be rusted and missing paint. The top of the pole had a plastic hanger on it where a medication bag had been hanging.  Inside a closet in the patient room, a large fan on a stand was pulled out of the closet. The fan was visibly soiled with dust, hair, and dirt. The last time the fan had been inspected was 7/9/16, 2 ½ years later ago. Staff #2 reported that the she was unaware the fan was kept in the room.   Inside the closet next to the fan, was a bedside commode found with plastic under the commode lid. The plastic was removed and the commode was full of old urine. Mold was growing inside the commode. The commode chair was soiled and had rusted. Staff #2 confirmed the urine was in the commode and was unsure why this was in a cleaned room. Staff #1 called in the house keeper and showed her the commode and instructed her to clean it.

    "# BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT has really shaken things up in the NLP world. The abilty of BERT and other transformer models was a step change in how NLP practitioners could solve NLP problems. With [Huggingface]() it got a whole load easier. In this part of the notebook we are going to use BERT to do some embedding of the text phrases we had above. We are going to compare them to USE. What I want is for you to understand:\n",
    "1. How simple BERT is to use\n",
    "2. What the differences are between BERT and USE\n",
    "3. The strengths and weaknesses of the BERT method of embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things to note. This is just a stepping stone and not a full immersion. Firstly, while you might have gone through this and will hopefully have understood a little more about this, to actually apply these models in practice takes much more learning - and hopefully the bar has been lowered to start doing that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, sadly this notebook is too short to do a good explaination of Transformers, and specifically BERT. However I can really recommend [Jay Alammar's](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/) blog posts on how transformers and BERT work. Clearly only if you are interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokenization\n",
    "For the USE model, you didn't need to think about tokenization. If you did the little extra vocab excercise and reading, then you would have see that it is word by word. If the word isn't in the dictionary that USE has, then you simply have an out of vocab word. BERT is different, and we will need to tokenize the word first, before putting it into the model. Tokenization is simply converting the word into a series of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is different from USE in that it splits the word down into small parts. This means that a word like `immunohematology` could potentially be split into `im`, `##mu`, `##no`, `##hem`, `##ato`, `##logy`. The double hash means it has a part of a word before it. This means that there are rarely any out of vocab words, and and even mispellings are often represented too.\n",
    "\n",
    "So lets start by importing the `BertTokenizer`, `BertModel` from Huggingface's `transformer` library, along with `torch` which is Pytorch."

    "However I would argue that none of these BERT are better than the USE model. That was kind of expected, because BERT isn't really designed to be used to create perfect embeddings out of the box. USE was trained and designed specifically to do that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Really BERT is much better at classification problems, or even finding masked words. But I hope you took three things out of this. Firstly that BERT isn't super scary to try and use, with a little more reading and playing around, you could try to start using it yourselves. Secondly that like all NLP problems (and I guess problems solving in general) you need to understand what is going on to see the potential pitfalls. Lastly, BERT has some real benifits over the USE model, espically when it comes to Vocab, but also what we haven't covered is that BERT can be trained and tailored to your language, while USE is what you get and nothing more.\n",

    "\n",
    "When we started the previous project, the only options we had for Transformer based embeddings, were USE or BERT - as we have shown above, along with a method called Sentence-BERT which gave Sentence Embeddings from Siamese BERT-Networks. That last one while it sounds complicated was a method which used text pairs to train embeddings. For a given sentence you have to show a stentence which is the same, one that is different, and one that is neutral. This is great if you have that information, but normal text problems don't have that much labeled data in that format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime an interesting developement has been made on that front which is an unsupervised approach called [SimCSE](https://www.sbert.net/examples/unsupervised_learning/SimCSE/README.html). This leverages the pretraining of BERT to develope embeddings from bert that are much more consistent than the ones above. Instead of training it on labeled text pairs we can just feed in some sentences. The result we hope is:\n",

    "1. The benifits of BERTs full language and vocabulary\n",

    "So this Sentence Bert method is a really promising addition to the toolbox. It also comes with the advantage that it is tuneable to ones own data, and also has full vocab coverage. Its a really good sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BUT** This is a toy example. You need to start trying this on your own data to see if this will be better. THis is where proper experimental methods will help give you a much more structured way to see if this method is better than USE, and what the pitfalls of this method are - because as always there will be some.\n",

    "1. How easy they are to do\n",
    "2. That much of the barrier to embeddings is in proper evaluation afterwards\n",
    "3. That each method has its pros and cons."
